# Colors:
Colors are used to convey meaning, create visual interest, and establish a brand identity.\
That is why Stelios can create entire websites even using just **one color**.

## Example
<Canvas of={ColorStories.Sample}/>

## Usage
For a website where Stelios is being used, kindly refer to [react-tutor](https://yuva0.github.io/react-tutor/).

## Acknowledgements
The color generation palette is created using Radix UI - [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors/custom).
