### Using ThemeProvider
ThemeProvider is the best way to deliver a uniform experience in your entire website.

Let's say you have your set of brand colors, where the primary colour is purple, success is green, warning is yellow, critical is red and info is blue.\
You can add it to the theme provider and all the buttons referring them will use the same colors using the same accent color.

###### Primary  | Success | Warning | Critical | Info
